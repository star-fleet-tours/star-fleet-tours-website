Join Star Fleet for the next launch of the most powerful rocket in history on SpaceX Starship Flight 9, featuring the first-ever reflown Super Heavy booster!
It'll be launching **No Earlier Than Tuesday May 27 at 6:30 PM CDT (23:30 UTC)** on the Flight 9 mission, which is expected to feature a high-energy hard ocean impact for Booster 14's second and final flight.
We plan to have boat trips to view the launch, as well as special pre-launch cruises!

Our planned [launch viewing location at the mouth of the South Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/search/26.052814,+-97.185356), approximately 4 miles / 7 km from the launch site with a direct line of sight across the water, provides some of the closest and clearest views of the pad, rocket, liftoff and booster landing available to the public.
Unlike the location where most other vessels anchor, this offers a closer and clearer sightline, and has calmer, less busy waters without the need to constantly jockey for position.

**LATEST LAUNCH UPDATE**:
As of Friday May 23, SpaceX has officially confirmed that they are actively targeting Tuesday May 27 for launch, road closures and FAA licensing have been issued, and the ship and booster have their pre-launch tests completed.
Therefore, we are opening ticket booking at 7 am CDT (12 UTC) on Saturday May 24 to view this launch on our chartered vessel _Fish Tales_!
Make sure to book before tickets sell out, and hope to see you there!

We also use it for early tickets, special community events and more!

**DELAY/SCRUB POLICY:** *Tickets are generally non-refundable.*<br>
Per agreement with our captains, if there is a delay announced prior to boarding the boat, your ticket will be valid for the new launch date and time.
Should you not be able to make the backup date, you are welcome to sell your ticket to others on standby, and we can help facilitate that as well.
If you'd like to request a refund, please call or message us at the Star Fleet number, [+1 321-209-2224](tel:+13212092224).
Should a launch day delay/scrub be officially announced after passengers have boarded the boat or if a passenger does not show up by the published boarding time, the boat will go out as scheduled, tickets will be considered used and will no longer be refundable.
Conversely, in case there is an issue with the boat or weather keeping us from departing for the launch, and it occurs as scheduled, we'll issue you a full refund.
