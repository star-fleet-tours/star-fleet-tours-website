Join Star Fleet to watch the mighty Delta IV Heavy launch on the historic final mission of the legendary Thor-Delta rocket family, after hundreds of flights spanning nearly 70 years.
The new launch date has been confirmed as **Tuesday, April 9 at 12:53 PM EDT** (16:53 UTC) with the top-secret NROL-70 mission for the US National Reconnaissance Office.

For this extended launch window spanning over four hours, we will be targeting an ocean-side viewing location just southeast of the launch safety area near [28° 30'N, 80° 28' W](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AscRDTb4ubBc3FgA9).
This is around 4 miles / 7 km offshore of the pad and in an ideal spot downrange of the trajectory, closer and clearer than any other available location.
In the event our captain judges the sea conditions to be too choppy to safely and comfortably experience the launch from this position, we will still go ocean-side, just potentially not quite as close, to a maximum of 8 mi / 12 km away.

**LATEST LAUNCH UPDATE**: As of the evening of April 5, the launch is GO for 12:53 PM EDT April 9, in a window that stretches until potentially as late as 6:51 PM in case of any delays.
Weather conditions are currently looking relatively good for an ocean-side viewing position, and we are committed ocean-side with the boat we have chartered.
We plan to take the larger Ocean Obsession II vessel out for this launch, which will provide a higher, more stable and more comfortable launch viewing platform.
