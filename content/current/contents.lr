Join Star Fleet for the next flight of the SpaceX Starship, the most powerful rocket in history!
It'll be be launching on **Wednesday, June 5 at 7:00 AM CDT** (12:00 UTC) with the Flight 4 mission, the next stage in Starship's flight testing for SpaceX and NASA in preparation for future missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond.

Our [viewing location at the mouth of the South Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/search/26.052814,+-97.185356), approximately 4 miles / 7 km from the launch site with a direct line of sight across the water, provides some of the closest and clearest views of the pad, rocket and liftoff available to the public.
Note that unlike the location just off the South Padre jetty where most other vessels moor, this offers a much clearer and slightly closer sightline, has calmer, more protected and less busy waters, and doesn't block the view of those watching from onshore.

*NOTE:* For scheduling reasons (we've launch enthusiasts just like you organizing Star Fleet trips out of passion :), be advised that neither Steven nor CAM will be present on site for this launch.
Our captain and crew is well briefed and practiced from previous trips, we'll have a number of community members on board and we'll be in direct contact with both throughout the trip, as well as with you all via phone, WhatsApp and social media.

**LATEST LAUNCH UPDATE**: As of the evening of May 29, the launch is GO for 7:00 AM June 5, in a window that stretches until 10 AM in case of any delays.
Accordingly, launch viewing tickets are on sale now!
Due to high demand, we expect the large boat we've chartered to sell out quickly, so make sure to book your tickets soon!

*We've created [a WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Llya3Ay1zvUAWXlM0N6eyH) that you're welcome to join, where folks are coordinating carpooling, accommodations, travel tips and more, as well as for updates from and questions to the Star Fleet organizers!

**DELAY/SCRUB POLICY:** *Tickets are generally non-refundable.*<br>
Per agreement with our captains, if there is a delay announced prior to the day of launch, your ticket will be valid for the new launch date and time.
If you canâ€™t make the backup date, you will be responsible for selling your ticket to others on standby, and we can help facilitate that as well.
If a launch day delay is officially announced later than 12 midnight CDT on the day of the launch trip (6 hours prior to departure), or if a passenger does not show up by the published boarding time, the boat will go out as scheduled, tickets will be considered used and will no longer be refundable.
Conversely, case there is an issue with the boat or weather keeping us from departing for the launch, and it occurs as scheduled, a full refund will be issued.
