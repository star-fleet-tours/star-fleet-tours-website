Join Star Fleet for to watch the mighty Delta IV Heavy launch on the historic final mission of the legendary Thor-Delta rocket family, after hundreds of flights spanning nearly 70 years.
It'll be be launching on **Thursday, March 28 at 1:40 PM EDT** (17:40 UTC) with the top-secret NROL-70 mission for the US National Reconnaissance Office.

For this launch, as weather and sea conditions allow and accounting for the extended launch window spanning over four hours, we will be ideally targeting an ocean-side viewing location just southeast of the launch safety area near [28° 30'N, 80° 28' W](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AscRDTb4ubBc3FgA9).
This is around 4 miles / 6 km offshore of the pad and in an ideal spot downrange of the trajectory, closer and clearer than any other available location.
As a backup, if our captains judge the sea conditions to be too choppy for a safe and comfortable experience ocean-side, we will instead go out [on the calm waters of the Banana River](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4TU6SyBN3ZeMzvqv6), less than 8 miles / 12 km from the launch site with a direct line of sight across the water.

**LATEST LAUNCH UPDATE**: As of the afternoon of March 24, the launch is GO for 1:40 PM EDT March 28, in a window that stretches until potentially as late as 6:50 PM in case of any delays.
Weather conditions are looking around 50/50 for an ocean- vs. river-side viewing position; we and our captains will continue to evaluate the weather and make the best call we can day of.
We expect to have a limited number of smaller boats available on this mission, so please book soon to secure your spot!
