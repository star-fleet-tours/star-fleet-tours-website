Join Star Fleet for the final launch of the Version 2 Booster and Ship on SpaceX Starship Flight 10, the last mission from Starbase expected until 2026!
The current launch date date is **No Earlier Than Monday October 13 at 6:15 PM CDT (23:15 UTC)** for the mission, and we'll be out there to view it!

Our planned [launch viewing location at the mouth of the South Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/search/26.052814,+-97.185356), approximately 4 miles / 7 km from the launch site with a direct line of sight across the water, provides some of the closest and clearest views of the pad, rocket, liftoff and booster landing available to the public.
Unlike the location where most other vessels anchor, this offers a closer and clearer sightline, and has calmer, less busy waters without the need to constantly jockey for position.

**LATEST LAUNCH UPDATE**:
As of the morning of Thursday October 9, Booster 15 has been rolled out to the launch site, and all hazard zones and closures are in place for a launch on Monday.
All that remains is rolling out Ship 38 and stacking it for flight.
Meanwhile, our boat tickets are now SOLD OUT for launch, but you can call or text us at [321-209-2224](tel:+13212092224) and we'll connect you with another of our long-time trusted captains who will get you to our same viewing spot.
As always, keep an eye here, on our social media or our WhatsApp community for the latest updates!

*We have **[a Whats App community](INSERT_URL_1) that we highly recommend you join**, with channels for announcements, insider launch updates, discussion, questions and more!
We also use it for early tickets, special community events and more!

**DELAY/SCRUB POLICY:** *Tickets are generally non-refundable.*<br>
Per agreement with our captains, if there is a delay announced prior to boarding the boat, your ticket will be valid for the new launch date and time.
Should you not be able to make the backup date, you are welcome to sell your ticket to others on standby, and we can help facilitate that as well.
If you'd like to request a refund, please call or message us at the Star Fleet number, [321-209-2224](tel:+13212092224).
Should a launch day delay/scrub be officially announced after passengers have boarded the boat or if a passenger does not show up by the published boarding time, the boat will go out as scheduled, tickets will be considered used and will no longer be refundable.
Conversely, in case there is an issue with the boat or weather keeping us from departing for the launch, and it occurs as scheduled, we'll issue you a full refund.
