Join Star Fleet for the next flight of the SpaceX Starship, the most powerful rocket in history!
It'll be be launching on **Thursday, March 14 at 7:00 AM CDT** (12:00 UTC) with the IFT-3 mission, the next stage in Starship's flight testing for SpaceX and NASA in preparation for future missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond.

Our [viewing location at the mouth of the South Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/search/26.052814,+-97.185356), approximately 4 miles / 7 km from the launch site with a direct line of sight across the water, provides some of the closest and clearest views of the pad, rocket and liftoff available to the public.

**LATEST LAUNCH UPDATE**: The launch is currently scheduled for 7:00 AM, in a window that stretches until 9 AM in case of any delays; backup dates are March 15 and 16, same time.
We've confirmed that are boats are available and good to go for the viewing window, so we've officially opened up bookings to the public!
Make sure to book soon, as we have a lot of demand on this launch, and trips often sell out.

Per agreement with our captains, if there is a delay announced prior to the day of launch, your ticket will be valid for the new launch date and time.
If you canâ€™t make the backup date, you will be responsible for selling your ticket to others on standby, and we can help facilitate that as well.
We will only be able to give a partial refund for an announced delay on the day of launch, prior to boarding.
Once passengers are boarding the boat, or if a passenger does not show up by the published boarding time, tickets will be considered used and will no longer be refundable.
In case there is an issue with the boat or weather keeping us from departing for the launch, and it occurs as scheduled, a full refund will be issued.
